# WordArt
In WordArt.ipynb, I improvised the WordCloud module developed by Andreas Mueller https://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-wordcloud-in-python.html, to allow more artistic creation of word cloud. My modified class WordArt allows the specification of primary keyword (featured in the center of the word cloud), secondary keywords (scattered around the primary keyword), and a list of background words and symbols. The core class IntegralOccupancyMap in the original WordCloud module is preserved for plotting the background words only, in order to populate the entire canvas. Furthermore, my improvised class allows the specification of different font styles and font colors for the primary, secondary, and background words and symbols.
To make such improvisation, I dived deep into the original WordCloud module and learned to use the pillow library and matplotlib colormap functionality. In addition, I custom designed several color palettes for harmony, aesthetic, and fun! This is still work in progress, and I planned to add other functinalities such as support for foreign languages in the future!
